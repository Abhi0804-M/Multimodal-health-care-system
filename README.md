# Multimodal-health-care-system
A smart healthcare system that detects anemia and skin diseases using non-invasive methods. It solves the problem of slow and scattered diagnosis by combining image analysis and health data to give quick, accurate, and accessible results.

# Multimodal Healthcare System  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project is an AI-powered *Multimodal Healthcare System* that focuses on the detection of *Anemia* and *Skin Diseases* using both *invasive and non-invasive methods*.  
The system addresses the problem of *slow and fragmented diagnosis* by combining medical image analysis (palm, eyelid, nail images, and skin images) with health data, providing *fast, accurate, and accessible predictions*.

## ðŸš€ Features  
- âœ… Non-invasive anemia detection using palm, eyelid, and nail images.  
- âœ… Skin disease classification through image processing and deep learning.  
- âœ… Supports multimodal inputs (images + basic health data).  
- âœ… Real-time and accurate predictions.  
- âœ… Unified system for early disease detection.
